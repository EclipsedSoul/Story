Think of the music of Mesopotamia, from around 2000 BCE. The only reason we can still attempt to play it today is because ancient Sumerians inscribed the notation for their songs into stone tablets. Think of the hunting techniques of our Palaeolithic ancestors. The only reason we have an idea about what these techniques involved is because we unearthed their carved weapons and tools. Museums are filled with these enduring messages about past cultural practices, coded into artefacts and ruins, or written onto parchment, papyrus and other kinds of media.
